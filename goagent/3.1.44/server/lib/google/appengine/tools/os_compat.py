"""OS cross-platform compatibility tweaks.

This module will, on import, change some parts of the running evironment so
that other modules do not need special handling when running on different
operating systems, such as Linux/Mac OSX/Windows.

Some of these changes must be done before other modules are imported, so
always import this module first.
