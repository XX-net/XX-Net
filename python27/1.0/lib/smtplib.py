'''SMTP/ESMTP client class.

This should follow RFC 821 (SMTP), RFC 1869 (ESMTP), RFC 2554 (SMTP
Authentication) and RFC 2487 (Secure SMTP over TLS).

Notes:

Please remember, when doing ESMTP, that the names of the SMTP service
extensions are NOT the same thing as the option keywords for the RCPT
and MAIL commands!

Example:

  >>> import smtplib
  >>> s=smtplib.SMTP("localhost")
  >>> print s.help()
  This is Sendmail version 8.8.4
  Topics:
      HELO    EHLO    MAIL    RCPT    DATA
      RSET    NOOP    QUIT    HELP    VRFY
      EXPN    VERB    ETRN    DSN
  For more info use "HELP <topic>".
  To report bugs in the implementation send email to
      sendmail-bugs@sendmail.org.
  For local information send email to Postmaster at your site.
  End of HELP info
  >>> s.putcmd("vrfy","someone@here")
  >>> s.getreply()
  (250, "Somebody OverHere <somebody@here.my.org>")
  >>> s.quit()
